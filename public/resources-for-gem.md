# NextMove resource catalog (for Gemini Gem)

Source: next-move
Version: 0.2.0
Program count: 41
Last generated for Gem upload. Prefer this file (or resources-for-gem.pdf) over resources.json for conversational grounding.

## How the Gem should use this catalog

1. Treat each PROGRAM block as one distinct resource. Do not merge programs.
2. Before recommending a program, check NOT FOR, ELIGIBILITY, COMPANY REQUIRED, MODALITY LOCK, and CONTEXT GATE.
3. Patents, licenses, and startups are vehicles — not destinations. Prefer academic returns when the investigator wants research impact, funding, trainees, or distribution without founding.
4. If COMPANY REQUIRED is no, do not imply the investigator must start a company.
5. If a CONTEXT GATE is listed, only recommend that program when the user's situation matches (for example emergency care, cancer, digital health).
6. If a MODALITY LOCK is listed, only recommend when the invention type matches (for example therapeutics-only or devices-only).
7. When unsure, ask a clarifying question rather than guessing eligibility.
8. Cite the OFFICIAL URL when pointing the investigator to a next step.

## PROGRAM: AI companion for new inventions

ID: otm-inventor-companion
ORGANIZATION: Neurotech Hub · Department of Neuroscience, WashU
OFFICIAL URL: https://neurotechhub.wustl.edu/an-ai-companion-for-new-inventions/
CONTACT: otm@wustl.edu · Neurotech Hub
LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: ip-licensing
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: therapeutic, device, diagnostic, software, research-tool
JOURNEY STAGES: s3, s4, s5
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-05
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
A short, structured AI interview (about 10 minutes) that produces a companion brief you can attach when filing an invention disclosure in InnovateIP. The preferred agent file includes interview instructions plus a periodically refreshed snapshot of public OTM pages.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Helps you clarify claims, novelty, evidence, and how the invention advances your professional goals before or while you talk with OTM — without replacing InnovateIP or OTM’s assessment.

USEFUL WHEN:
- You are preparing an invention disclosure or exploring whether to disclose
- You want a clearer story for an OTM case manager
- You have a nascent idea and want structured feedback before filing

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- treat this as a substitute for filing in InnovateIP
- use a consumer AI chat that may store or train on unpublished inventions
- treat the brief as legal advice, a patent search, or OTM’s formal evaluation

ELIGIBILITY:
Any WashU inventor preparing disclosure context. Use only a WashU-supported AI tool approved for institutional use with confidentiality controls for unpublished inventions.

CAVEATS:
- Alpha tool from the Neurotech Hub — not an official WashU or OTM product; workflows may change.
- Use only an institutionally approved AI tool. Consumer ChatGPT and similar tools can create a public-disclosure risk.
- The official record remains the InnovateIP disclosure; attach the brief as a companion document.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- a short companion brief for OTM
- clearer invention story before disclosure
- preliminary landscape and goal-routing context

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- disclosure
- ip
- transfer
- clarity

PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Administrative and clinical research services spanning the clinical-study lifecycle, from initial proposal through study close-out. CCS is also the institutional home/partner for several specialized clinical-trial support services.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Once the next translational milestone requires a human study, the bottleneck is often execution rather than invention strategy. CCS is a practical door into study operations without requiring a company or license path.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A device, therapeutic, diagnostic, digital intervention, or workflow is moving into human research
- You need help planning or executing the operational side of a clinical study
- You are unsure which specialized clinical-study service should own the next problem

DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen_program_verify_current_call
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: therapeutic
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
An integrated small-molecule drug-discovery path from lead finding through lead optimization and preclinical studies. CDD capabilities include high-throughput and virtual screening, medicinal chemistry, ADME, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, in vivo pharmacology, and safety-oriented preclinical work. CDD also operates several pilot/matching funding mechanisms.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Fills the gap between a biologically interesting target and a credible therapeutic program. It can generate chemical matter and preclinical evidence before an IND-oriented program is mature enough for resources such as Needleman.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A target or assay needs small-molecule hit finding or screening
- A promising hit needs medicinal chemistry, ADME, PK/PD, or in vivo optimization
- You need preliminary drug-discovery data for follow-on grants, partnering, publication, or IP

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Non-therapeutic devices or software
- A generic wet-lab core unrelated to small-molecule discovery
- Assume every CDD funding program has the same eligibility or deadline

ELIGIBILITY:
CDD services are directed at WashU drug-discovery projects. The CDD Pilot Grant and Match Grant programs state WashU faculty eligibility; the Siteman QuikSTART program additionally requires Assistant Professor-or-above status and Siteman Cancer Center membership. Verify the current funding mechanism before applying.

CAVEATS:
- Funding programs have different eligibility, cost-share, and cycle requirements.
- QuikSTART is specifically for translating cancer disease biology into small-molecule therapeutics and requires Siteman membership.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- screening hits and chemical starting points
- medicinal-chemistry and preclinical data
- preliminary data for grants, publications, partnering, and IP

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- drug-discovery
- high-throughput-screening
- medicinal-chemistry
- preclinical-development
- funding

FUNDING:
CDD Pilot, Match Grant, QuikSTART and other CDD mechanisms; amounts and cycles vary. QuikSTART is $25,000 and cancer/small-molecule specific.

WHAT YOU GET:
Hands-on regulatory support for human-subjects studies, including protocol and consent development, IRB submissions and maintenance, FDA drug/device submissions such as IND/IDE applications, monitoring, study coordination, audits, and study close-out.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Turns 'we need a regulatory plan' into concrete study and submission work. This is especially important when the next milestone depends on an FDA-regulated drug, device, or investigator-initiated clinical study.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A human study needs IRB, IND/IDE, monitoring, or regulatory planning
- You need help translating a protocol into the institutional and FDA submission path
- Regulatory execution is becoming the blocker to a clinical milestone

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Patent prosecution or technology licensing
- General FDA market strategy detached from a research study

ELIGIBILITY:
Designed for ICTS investigators conducting human-subjects research. Service level and project requirements vary; request support through the RSC/CCS process.

CAVEATS:
- Regulatory support does not itself substitute for required HRPO/IRB or FDA approvals.
- Some services may carry project-specific costs or coordination requirements.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- a concrete regulatory execution plan
- IND/IDE and IRB submission support
- lower operational friction for investigator-initiated trials

JOURNEY STAGES: s4, s5, s6, s7, s8
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: only when context includes industry-collaboration, industry-sponsored-research

WHAT YOU GET:
University-wide drafting, review, negotiation, and signature of research-related agreements, including industry-supported research agreements, industry-supported clinical trials, data transfers, service agreements, collaborations, and federal/foundation contracts and subawards.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Industry collaboration is a distinct path from licensing or founding. If an outside organization wants to fund, collaborate on, test, or exchange data around the work, JROC is often the contract path that makes that relationship executable.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A company or outside collaborator wants to sponsor research rather than license the invention
- You need a clinical-trial, collaboration, service, data-use, or sponsored-research agreement
- The scientific partnership is clear but the institutional agreement is not

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Patent prosecution or licensing university IP (see OTM)
- Finding an industry partner from scratch

ELIGIBILITY:
WashU research agreements. JROC serves principal investigators, administrators, and sponsors university-wide; the required intake path depends on agreement type.

CAVEATS:
- JROC executes research-related agreements; OTM handles patent licensing and many material-transfer/IP matters.
- This is not an industry matchmaking program.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- an executable sponsored-research or collaboration agreement
- a compliant path for industry-funded studies and data exchange
- industry collaboration without requiring a startup or license

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- industry-sponsored-research
- research-contracts
- clinical-trial-agreements

Consultation and implementation support for mHealth and digital-health research using smartphones, websites, sensors, wearables, remote study methods, and related technology. The core also provides guidance on topics such as remote research, technology partnerships, and FDA Part 11-regulated digital workflows.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Provides a WashU-specific bridge between a digital-health idea and a fundable, executable human-research project — a gap that generic software development or clinical-study support does not fully cover.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A study uses wearables, sensors, apps, web tools, telehealth, or remote data collection
- You need to design or operationalize an mHealth research workflow
- Digital tools introduce Part 11, vendor, remote-consent, or implementation questions

CAVEATS:
- This is a research implementation core, not a software accelerator or venture program.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- a fundable digital-health study plan
- remote-study and mHealth implementation support
- clearer regulatory and vendor choices for digital research

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- digital-health
- mhealth

DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen_program_verify_current_call
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
NIH SBIR/STTR funding for eligible U.S. small businesses conducting biomedical R&D. The program can support scientists, engineers, prototypes, validation, and commercialization-oriented research while preserving equity; institute-specific scientific fit still matters.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
A major non-dilutive funding route once product-oriented biomedical R&D belongs inside an eligible U.S. small business. Keep this card broad; use institute-specific cards such as NINDS Translational Devices when the modality and disease area justify them.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A biomedical product-oriented project has a credible small-business path
- A company needs non-dilutive R&D funding before or alongside private capital
- You need to distinguish SBIR/STTR from academic-only grant mechanisms

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- An academic laboratory acting alone; the applicant must be an eligible U.S. small business
- Assume this replaces institute-specific scientific fit or current NOFO review

ELIGIBILITY:
SBIR/STTR applicant must meet U.S. small-business eligibility. Universities may participate as research partners/subawardees; STTR has formal research-institution participation requirements. Confirm current NIH and institute-specific rules before submission.

CAVEATS:
- An academic lab alone is not an SBIR/STTR applicant.
- Use the separate NINDS Translational Devices card for nervous-system therapeutic/diagnostic device programs and Missouri SBDC for local proposal assistance.
- I-Corps at NIH is generally downstream of a qualifying Phase I award — not an entry program.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- substantial non-dilutive company R&D funding
- funded technical and translational milestones
- a bridge to later validation and commercialization work

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- funding
- small-business

FUNDING:
NIH SBIR/STTR (verify current NOFO and institute fit)

CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Support for development, optimization, translation, and first-in-human testing of therapeutic and diagnostic devices. NINDS also has dedicated small-business programs.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
A neuroscience-specific route that can finance evidence R01-style projects often do not emphasize.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A device or neurotechnology addresses a nervous-system disorder
- You need milestone-driven translation, regulatory preparation, or first-in-human work

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- A generic assumption that every NINDS device NOFO is academic — some are small-business-only

ELIGIBILITY:
Depends on the specific NOFO. Some routes are academic; others are small-business-only. Inspect the current announcement.

CAVEATS:
- Do not infer eligibility from the program family. Read the current NOFO.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- device-translation milestones
- possible first-in-human support

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- device-translation
- funding

COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Disclosure intake, evaluation, patent/IP strategy, marketing, licensing, and commercialization support. The disclosure asks for an invention description, creators, funding, and related information.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Lets you understand transfer options without deciding to become an entrepreneur. OTM evaluates WashU inventions, handles patent strategy, and files when warranted — a conversation before a talk or paper is how that process starts.

USEFUL WHEN:
- Something developed in the lab may have utility outside it
- You want to preserve transfer or commercialization options
- You are choosing among protect, license, distribute, or open-release

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- need this as a required first step for every research idea
- treat this as a substitute for deciding what success looks like to you

ELIGIBILITY:
WashU inventions; assignment and contact depend on academic unit. OTM’s department lookup includes neuroscience-related units.

CAVEATS:
- OTM evaluates WashU inventions and, when warranted, files and manages the patents.
- A startup is not required.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- clarity on transfer options
- possible protection before public disclosure

## PROGRAM: OTM Experts-in-Residence (XiR)

ID: xir
ORGANIZATION: Office of Technology Management, WashU
OFFICIAL URL: https://otm.wustl.edu/items/experts-in-residence/
CONTACT: Start with OTM · otm@wustl.edu
LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: expertise-mentorship
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: device, diagnostic, software, therapeutic, research-tool
JOURNEY STAGES: s4, s5, s6
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: yes
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Access to experienced expertise within the OTM innovation network. OTM publishes XiR eligibility for participating experts; expert participation itself is invitation-only.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
You do not have to independently locate every expert. This is domain judgment, not a request that you become a founder.

USEFUL WHEN:
- The project needs experienced external judgment rather than general business instruction
- You want to define a product, technical, or milestone question

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Founder coaching (see EIR / New Ventures)
- Open office hours without OTM context

ELIGIBILITY:
Researcher-facing routing criteria are unspecified publicly; access should be treated as OTM-mediated.

CAVEATS:
- Start with OTM. Do not treat XiR as a walk-in mentoring pool.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- targeted expert advice
- clearer next technical or product milestone

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- expertise
- external-feedback

## PROGRAM: OTM New Ventures / Entrepreneur-in-Residence

ID: otm-eir
ORGANIZATION: Office of Technology Management, WashU
OFFICIAL URL: https://otm.wustl.edu/disclose-inventions/new-ventures/
CONTACT: OTM New Ventures · otm@wustl.edu
LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: startup-support, expertise-mentorship
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: therapeutic, device, diagnostic, software
JOURNEY STAGES: s7, s8
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: yes
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Founder coaching, business-case and value-proposition refinement, business-model work, and startup mentoring. The EIR program is administered through New Ventures.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Faculty can explore company formation without personally having all CEO or business-development expertise. Startup intent is relevant; this is not the default path for every disclosed invention.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A startup is becoming a plausible vehicle
- Scientific founders need experienced company-building help

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Investigators who want licensing or distribution without founding
- Early ideas with no company hypothesis

ELIGIBILITY:
OTM states that the research team’s WashU patent must be foundational to the startup license; EIR connection is at New Ventures’ discretion.

CAVEATS:
- EIR placement is only for teams focused on a startup based on WashU IP; an already-incorporated company is not the stated prerequisite.
- EIR requires a patent disclosure, foundational WashU patent rights for the startup license, a pitch deck developed with New Ventures, and coachability; placement is discretionary.
- This is founder support, not general scientific mentoring.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- company-building coaching
- a clearer go/no-go on founding
- possible license path

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- startup
- founder-coaching
- business-model

## PROGRAM: OTM Quick Start License

ID: quick-start-license
ORGANIZATION: Office of Technology Management, WashU
OFFICIAL URL: https://otm.wustl.edu/disclose-inventions/quick-start-license/
CONTACT: OTM New Ventures · otm@wustl.edu
LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: ip-licensing, startup-support
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: therapeutic, device, diagnostic, software
JOURNEY STAGES: s8
PRIORITY: second
COMPANY REQUIRED: yes
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: yes
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
A standardized startup license. Current public terms include no WashU equity and a fixed 2% patent royalty on product sales, with additional sublicense terms.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Can simplify license formation once a WashU-IP startup is actually the vehicle — not a reason to create one.

USEFUL WHEN:
- A qualifying WashU-IP startup is ready to license foundational university patent rights
- Standardized terms could reduce negotiation burden

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Investigators who want to license to an existing company rather than found
- An early idea with no company hypothesis

ELIGIBILITY:
Qualifying startup and IP conditions apply. Contact OTM before assuming eligibility.

CAVEATS:
- This is a vehicle after startup direction is credible, not a reason to incorporate.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- a simpler license path once founding is justified

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- license
- startup

MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
St. Louis-headquartered life-science VC that funds and founds biopharma and device companies and can lead financing syndicates.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Relevant when the question has moved from “is there a product?” to “is this a venture-scale company?”

USEFUL WHEN:
- A biopharma or medical-device company needs sophisticated company formation or venture financing

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Academic projects
- Pre-company de-risking

ELIGIBILITY:
Company and investment diligence required; terms are opportunity-specific.

CAVEATS:
- Downstream financing. Not a faculty program.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- venture-scale company formation and capital

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- funding
- startup

FUNDING:
Venture financing (deal-specific)

## PROGRAM: Siteman Investment Program Research Development Awards (SIP RDA)

ID: siteman-sip-rda
ORGANIZATION: Siteman Cancer Center, WashU
OFFICIAL URL: https://siteman.washu.edu/research/funding-opportunities/
LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: funding
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: therapeutic, device, diagnostic, software, research-tool
JOURNEY STAGES: s1, s2, s3, s6
PRIORITY: second
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen_program_verify_current_call
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: only when context includes cancer

WHAT YOU GET:
Pilot funding for pioneering cancer research intended to generate data that can leverage external peer-reviewed funding. The program spans cancer discovery, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, prevention, and translational/implementation work depending on the current cycle.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
For cancer-related inventions or enabling technologies, the immediate need may be stronger scientific or translational evidence rather than a commercialization grant. SIP RDA is a major internal pilot-funding route for that work.

USEFUL WHEN:
- The project is cancer-related and needs pilot or preliminary data
- A defined experiment could unlock an NIH/NCI application or translational next step

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Projects with no cancer relevance
- Assume a standing open call or fixed award amount without checking the current RFA

ELIGIBILITY:
Siteman membership and cycle-specific eligibility apply. Current RFA terms should be checked before routing an investigator to the program.

CAVEATS:
- This is cancer-research pilot funding, not a startup program.
- Eligibility and award categories change by cycle; verify the current RFA.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- pilot data
- external-grant leverage
- cross-disciplinary cancer collaborations

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- pilot-funding
- preliminary-data
- cancer

FUNDING:
Pilot funding; amount and categories are cycle-specific

PRIORITY: second
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-07
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
In-Residence mentoring from experienced entrepreneurs and industry advisors, plus IdeaBounce events for pitching, feedback, and networking.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Useful before committing to a venture. You do not need a finished company or investor deck.

USEFUL WHEN:
- You want founder or industry feedback on how an idea is communicated
- You want a low-stakes venue before venture commitment

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- A WashU-IP faculty invention seeking the Venture Competition awards
- A substitute for OTM evaluation

ELIGIBILITY:
Skandalaris services broadly include WashU faculty, staff, students, and alumni; individual event requirements vary.

CAVEATS:
- Do not confuse this with the Skandalaris Venture Competition.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- early feedback
- network without a finished deck

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- feedback
- networking
- venture-exploration

DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen_program_verify_current_call
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
Competition awards. Fall 2026 materials describe an awards pool of up to $25,000, subject to limits per startup.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
Can provide venture validation and money for an eligible student or recent-alumni venture that does not rely on university IP. It should normally be suppressed for a faculty WashU-IP invention.

USEFUL WHEN:
- An eligible student or recent-alumni venture does not rely on university IP

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- Faculty inventions that are WashU IP
- Any startup whose license is to WashU or another university’s IP

ELIGIBILITY:
Qualifying WashU student or recent alum and ownership rules apply. WashU IP is not permitted, nor is a license to IP from WashU or another university.

CAVEATS:
- Critical trap: current rules prohibit WashU / university IP and licenses to university IP.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- venture validation — only if you are actually eligible

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- startup
- competition

FUNDING:
Awards pool up to $25,000 (verify current cycle)

NEEDS ADDRESSED: startup-support, expertise-mentorship
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: device, software, research-tool, therapeutic, diagnostic
JOURNEY STAGES: s4, s6, s7, s8
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: none

WHAT YOU GET:
30-minute advising on brainstorming, business plans, financial models, pitching, and next-step guidance.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
An excellent low-commitment way to ask whether entrepreneurship is even sensible. No incorporation or mature startup is required.

USEFUL WHEN:
- You want help thinking through an idea, model, or next entrepreneurial step
- You are exploring founding without committing to it

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- The Skandalaris Venture Competition — current rules prohibit WashU / university IP and licenses to university IP
- A substitute for OTM evaluation of a WashU invention

ELIGIBILITY:
WashU students, faculty, staff, and alumni; ventures may be at any stage.

CAVEATS:
- Do not confuse Venture Development advising with the Skandalaris Venture Competition.
- SVC currently excludes WashU IP — a common mis-route for faculty inventions.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- a low-stakes read on whether a company is justified
- help framing a model or pitch if you proceed

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- venture-exploration
- business-model
- pitch

LOCATION: washu
SCOPE: washu
NEEDS ADDRESSED: build-test, expertise-mentorship
INVENTION TYPES: broad
DOMAINS: therapeutic, device, diagnostic, software, clinical-workflow
JOURNEY STAGES: s6, s7, s8
PRIORITY: unspecified
COMPANY REQUIRED: no
DISCLOSURE TYPICALLY NEEDED: no
STATUS: evergreen
LAST VERIFIED: 2026-09-06
MODALITY LOCK: none
CONTEXT GATE: only when context includes multicenter-trial

WHAT YOU GET:
Enhanced support for WashU faculty conducting investigator-initiated clinical trials, especially multi-center studies. Trial-CARE helps with startup and implementation, single-IRB and master-agreement pathways, regulatory resources, anticipated barriers, coordination, and tailored recruitment planning.

WHY AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT CARE:
A technically ready intervention can still fail to travel because a multi-site trial is hard to start and coordinate. Trial-CARE is a concrete execution resource once the next proof requires investigator-initiated clinical testing across sites.

USEFUL WHEN:
- You are planning an investigator-initiated clinical trial
- A multi-center study needs startup, coordination, single-IRB, agreement, or recruitment support
- The evidence milestone is clinically clear but operationally difficult

NOT FOR (do not recommend when):
- A single preclinical experiment
- General commercialization or founder coaching

ELIGIBILITY:
Washington University faculty conducting investigator-initiated clinical trials. Trial-CARE advertises a free consultation; project support depends on trial needs.

CAVEATS:
- Best fit is investigator-initiated clinical-trial execution, particularly multi-center work.

ACADEMIC RETURNS:
- faster and more structured trial startup
- coordination and recruitment planning
- a path through multi-site operational barriers

PROBLEMS SOLVED:
- multicenter-trial
- trial-startup
- recruitment
- single-irb
